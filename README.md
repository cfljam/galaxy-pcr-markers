==================

Scripts for design of PCR-based Marker Assays from DNA sequence variant data, and xml wrappers for use in  Galaxy  workflow environment

Also available for download at Galaxy Toolshed http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/
hg clone http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/john-mccallum/pcr_markers

NOTE that the primer design tools rely on EMBOSS ePrimer3 which depends on Primer3 1.1.4.
We are working to add automatic tool dependency management for Galaxy
